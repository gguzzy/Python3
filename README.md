# WebDevelopment-IoT-technologies-for-embedded-systems
Collection of problem solving exercises using Python 3.

Each exercise try to analyze different problems, different approaches to the same problem, and different ranges.

This has to be seen a specific proof of managing algorithms as written above, and to demonstrate the usage of Python in Web Development (backend using CherryPy framework, Javascript as well to enhance scripts, and frontend using HTML and CSS) for IoT systems using Arduino Yun Wi-FI.

The exercises regarding the IoT part has been realized during the course of 'Tecnologie per Iot' in Politecnico of Turin.

The final project for the course was fundamental to consolidate the skills for: BACKEND, FRONTEND, and EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.
The aim of the project was to create an IoT real-life project using the features we learned: Python 3, CherryPy framework for Web-Server configuration, HTML, CSS. Moreover I learned also JS in order to implement the WEB-CLIENT interface, with more features. This brought me to use JavaScript for both Front-Back end using (REACT&EXPRESS/also some NodeJs).

- 11/19/2020: Up to now, only the classes and main problems in Python have been inserted. React and Node Js will not be inserted in any case here, since I want to differ the topics. Here I want to highlign the ability of learning new languages, new Web paradigm (HTTP, using Send-Request and Client-Server, MQTT protocols and Arduino Bridge configuration and so forth). Of course, adapting to new languages and framework (instead of CherryPy, just to take an example) has been a natural process in order to complete new type of projects.
